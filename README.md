# What does community mean to you?

I chose to use the song "Count on me" by Bruno Mars for Project Two, as it shows that within a communtiy trust needs to be built for the community to be strong. It also represents to choose the right people around you that you can rely on to have your back. 

The lyrics share, "You can count on me, like one, two, three, I'll be there. And I know when I need it, I can count on you." These lyrics define communtiy to me as it teaches community is the people around you that you call family and friends. The trust between those people is what holds the community together. With trust there is love, patience, and kindness.
