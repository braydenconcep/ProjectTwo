# What does community mean to you?

# project overview

I chose to use the song "Count on me" by Bruno Mars for Project Two, as it shows that within a communtiy trust needs to be built for the community to be strong. It also represents to choose the right people around you that you can rely on to have your back. 

The lyrics share, "You can count on me, like one, two, three, I'll be there. And I know when I need it, I can count on you." These lyrics define communtiy to me as it teaches community is the people around you that you call family and friends. The trust between those people is what holds the community together. With trust there is love, patience, and kindness. 

# technical overview

For the font I decided to use the "Permanent Marker" as it matched with the song. When I see the font I think calm, playful, and handwritten. This matches with the song, as it makes you feel that the song is written towards you.

Languages used:

-HTML: The framework of the website, holding all my text in order.

-CSS: Styling the website with color, font-size, placement, and overall layout. 

Animation, Transitions, and Transformations:

I used a lot of scrolling animation to make the text slide into place, then fade out. This allowed me to click one time and all the animation will take place instead of hovering over a word. My transitions included a lot of animation delays so it would start accordingly and give you time to read the text. The transformations I used translated, scaled, rotated, faded, and enlarged different aspects of my website. 

Separating my classes helped to give similar effects to multiple parts of thr website. Having a delay class numbered 1 second to 30 seconds helped transition into different effects. 

Placing my "a" tag before the "body" tag I was able to click anywhere on the site to change to the next page. 

The main three effects I used was making the text slide into frame, fade out of frame, and also enlarge the text. I was able to use these main concepts for many aspects of my text and make the website more uniform. 

Using the universal selector in CSS I was able to center my text, add a font to my text, change the color of text and background, and change the sizing.

Resources I used to create my website:

-One of my friends who is a Computer Science major helped me to format, animate, and edit my website.

-Youtube: Simple Text Animation Just By Using HTML & CSS - DarkCode -
This helped me to create the animation I have for my title page making the text space in and out. 

-Youtube: Bouncing Texr Animation using HTML & CSS - Code Instinct - 
This helped me create the effect to make my text move up or move down. 

-Class Assignments in DES 228 with Joshua Oakley to learn and recall different aspects I wanted to use in my site.
